# open_fitness_tracker

Check out the [Live Demo](https://openfitnesstracker.app/#/Exercises)

## What is this? There's already 100 fitness trackers.
This tracks your sets & reps. Real basic for now. More stuff coming soon.
It's true - there's a bunch of other apps like this! 
But this one is open source. It's free. There's no subscription. There's no other open app like this.

I'm just doing this because I want it to exist.  
I want those high schoolers with such great potential and energy to have the chance to hone the strength of their youth without paying a subscription fee.
